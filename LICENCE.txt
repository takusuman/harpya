The design and implementation of this program was entirely made by me
to solve a problem, which was searching for registries at the ANCINE website ---
since Brazil gov't is a joke and don't offer a simple API for doing this.

Harpya is entirely in public domain.  However, the author would appreciate
some credit if this program and/or parts of it are used in another program.
